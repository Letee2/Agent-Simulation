# Agent-Simulation
Agent-based simulation in Python 

The purpose of this project is to create an enviroment populated with agents that have several attributes(health,food,stamina,etc.). They interact while the simulation runs and all the data is then gathered and processed for machine learning purposes.
Besides, I have implemented many methods that allow to visualize and study the behaviour of these agents, in order to find patterns that lead to either die or survive during the simulation.
